# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Validation Results

### Document Overview
This document explains the outputs generated by the statistical and graphical analysis pipeline implemented in the `EDAStatisticalAnalysis` and `EDAGraphicalAnalysis` classes. The goal is to interpret each result, explain what it means, and suggest how it can be used to inform future decisions or actions regarding the dataset.

## 1. **Descriptive Statistics**

### **Result Explanation**
The descriptive statistics provide a summary of each numerical column in the dataset, including:
- **Mean**: The average value.
- **Standard Deviation (std)**: A measure of how spread out the values are.
- **Minimum (min)** and **Maximum (max)**: The range of values.
- **Quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%)**: Values at specific percentiles that divide the data into four equal parts.

### **Purpose**
- **Mean** gives us an idea of the central tendency, while **standard deviation** tells us how much variability exists in the data.
- **Min and Max** help in understanding the range, which can be useful to detect outliers or check if values fall within expected limits.
- **Quartiles** are particularly helpful to observe the distribution of values and identify potential skewness.

### **How to Use It**
- Detect **outliers**: If the min or max is far from the quartiles, there may be extreme values in the data.
- **Data normalization**: Knowing the mean and standard deviation can guide scaling processes for machine learning models.
- **Feature engineering**: Features with high variability (high std) might require transformation, or those with very low variability might not be useful.

## 2. **Correlation Matrix**

### **Result Explanation**
The correlation matrix shows the strength and direction of the linear relationship between different variables (in this case, the sensors and reference values). The correlation coefficient varies between -1 and 1:
- **1**: Perfect positive correlation.
- **-1**: Perfect negative correlation.
- **0**: No linear correlation.

### **Purpose**
This result is useful for identifying how closely the sensor measurements track the reference values and each other. A high correlation means that two variables move together, while a low or negative correlation suggests they move independently or inversely.

### **How to Use It**
- **Feature selection**: Strongly correlated variables can be redundant, so it might be useful to select only one or combine them into a new feature.
- **Model interpretation**: A high correlation between the sensors and the reference value indicates that these sensors provide valuable predictive information.
- **Outlier detection**: Sensors with very low correlation to the reference value may need to be investigated further to understand if they are faulty.

## 3. **Error Analysis (Absolute and Relative Errors)**

### **Result Explanation**
- **Absolute error**: The absolute difference between the measured value and the reference value. It provides the magnitude of the error.
- **Relative error**: The absolute error divided by the reference value. It provides the error as a percentage of the reference.

### **Purpose**
The error analysis allows you to quantify the accuracy of the sensor measurements compared to the reference values. Lower errors mean the sensors are more accurate.

### **How to Use It**
- **Model evaluation**: Use these errors to assess how well the sensor data tracks the true reference values. High errors might indicate faulty sensors or poorly calibrated ones.
- **Sensor comparison**: Compare the errors across sensors to determine which sensor gives the most accurate readings.
- **Sensor recalibration**: High errors might suggest that certain sensors require recalibration to improve accuracy.

## 4. **ANOVA Test**

### **Result Explanation**
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests if there are statistically significant differences between the means of multiple groups (sensor measurements). The results include:
- **F-value**: The ratio of variance between groups to the variance within groups.
- **P-value**: The probability that the observed differences happened by chance.

### **Purpose**
ANOVA is useful to determine whether the sensor measurements differ significantly from each other or from the reference.

### **How to Use It**
- **Sensor validation**: A significant p-value (usually < 0.05) suggests that there are real differences between the sensors, and some may not be performing as expected.
- **Investigate specific sensors**: If the ANOVA test shows significant results, further investigation may be needed to understand why some sensors are systematically different.

## 5. **Linear Regression Model**

### **Result Explanation**
A linear regression model is fitted to the data, predicting the reference value using one or more sensor measurements. The output includes:
- **Model coefficients**: The contribution of each sensor to the predicted value.
- **Predictions**: The model’s predicted reference values based on sensor data.

### **Purpose**
Linear regression is used to understand how the sensor data relates to the reference values and to make predictions based on the sensor readings.

### **How to Use It**
- **Predictive model**: This model can be used to predict future reference values using sensor data.
- **Feature importance**: Coefficients of the linear model provide insight into which sensors are most influential in predicting the reference value.
- **Model refinement**: If the model performs poorly, it may suggest that non-linear relationships or additional features need to be considered.

## 6. **Model Validation (MSE, MAE, R2)**

### **Result Explanation**
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: The average squared difference between the actual and predicted reference values. Lower values indicate better accuracy.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: The average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.
- **R² (R-squared)**: The proportion of the variance in the reference value that is predictable from the sensor measurements.

### **Purpose**
These metrics provide an evaluation of how well the regression model fits the data.

### **How to Use It**
- **Model comparison**: Use these metrics to compare different models or variations of sensor inputs. Lower MSE and MAE indicate better models, while R² close to 1 means the model explains most of the variance.
- **Model refinement**: Poor performance on these metrics might suggest the need for a more complex model or additional features.

## 7. **Residual Analysis**

### **Result Explanation**
The residuals are the differences between the actual and predicted reference values. A residual plot helps identify any patterns that the model has not captured.

### **Purpose**
Residuals are used to check the quality of the regression model by observing whether there is any unexplained pattern or bias in the errors.

### **How to Use It**
- **Model diagnosis**: If the residuals show a clear pattern (e.g., increasing or decreasing trends), it indicates that the model is not capturing all the relevant information.
- **Model refinement**: Large residuals or patterns suggest that the model needs to be improved, possibly by adding more features or trying a non-linear model.

## 8. **Graphical Analysis (Histograms, Boxplots, Correlation Heatmaps, Scatter Plots, Residual Plots)**

### **Result Explanation**
- **Histograms**: Show the distribution of sensor data, helping identify whether the data is normally distributed or skewed.
- **Boxplots**: Visualize the spread and outliers in the sensor measurements.
- **Correlation Heatmaps**: Graphically represent the correlation matrix, highlighting strong and weak correlations.
- **Scatter Plots**: Display relationships between sensor measurements and the reference value.
- **Residual Plots**: Show how well the model fits the data by plotting the residuals against the predicted values.

### **Purpose**
These plots provide visual insight into the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data that are not always evident from numerical summaries.

### **How to Use It**
- **Data understanding**: Use histograms and boxplots to understand the overall distribution and spread of the data.
- **Feature selection**: Use correlation heatmaps and scatter plots to identify which sensors are most relevant for predicting the reference value.
- **Model validation**: Use residual plots to visually assess the quality of the model and identify areas for improvement.
